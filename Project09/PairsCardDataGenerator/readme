This project was created to automate the data creation of images and animation bits. The data was created from text files containing 1s and 0s representing the black and white pixels in each image. The bits were converted to decimal numbers by the program and written to array-returning functions. The binary text files are located in `CardsBinaryData`, the image from which they were generated are located in `CardsBinaryImages`, though they are not used in the program. The program writes to `CardsData.jack`, which will appear in the same directory as the program when it's done running.

Most of the images were generated in chatgpt.com. Others were downloaded from vectorstock.com.
The images were converted to binary text in dcode.fr/binary-image.
